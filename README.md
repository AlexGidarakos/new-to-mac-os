# New to macOS

A collection of personal notes I am keeping while I set up and customise the macOS environment running on my employer-issued laptop, a 2021 MacBook Pro M1.

Having no prior experience with macOS, it has been very disheartening to see my productivity taking a hit, from mistakes in keyboard shortcuts because of muscle memory, to missing utilities I was used to in Windows and trying to find alternatives. These notes record my attempts to work around all these issues little by little.

If you are going through the same process and are now reading this, I hope that you find some of these notes useful!
