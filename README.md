# New to macOS

A collection of personal notes I am keeping while I set up and customise the macOS environment running on the my computer, i.e. a 2021 MacBook Pro M1.

Having no prior experience with macOS, it has been very disheartening to see my productivity taking a massive hit, with constant mistakes in keyboard shortcuts because of muscle memory to missing the usual utilities I was used to in Windows and trying to find alternatives.

If you are going through the same process and are now reading this, I hope that you find some of these notes useful!
