# New to macOS

A collection of notes I have been keeping while I customise the macOS environment running on my employer-issued 2021 MacBook Pro M1.

Having no prior experience with macOS, at first I saw my productivity taking a hit, caused by muscle-memory mistakes in keyboard shortcuts, missing utilities I was used to in Windows and trying to find alternatives, etc. These notes record my attempts to work around all these issues little by little.

If you are going through a similar transition, I hope you find some of these notes useful!
